    "Since gambling activity in many countries of the world has been moved to dedicated zones, completely or partially banned, the online gambling industry has been actively developing. Online casinos have millions of fans. But even experienced players are not always well versed in choosing a virtual institution, hundreds of which have been opened over the past 10-15 years. The more the site provides opportunities for replenishment of the account, the better. After all, the financial part of the issue in gambling for money is of paramount importance. Free play is the best way to learn how your favorite slot machine or board game works. Without payment, it is impossible to play only card games, some lotteries and live dealer roulette.",

    "The first two methods are the main ones and are present in almost all offices. The exact list of available payment methods depends on your geographic location. Some methods can work only in one direction: only for replenishment, but not for withdrawal - or vice versa. The speed of processing applications depends on the payment system. When replenishing a deposit, funds are usually credited to the account instantly. Withdrawal of winnings can take from several hours to several days. Most payment systems charge fees for their services, and the bookmaker cannot influence the amount of these payments. You can specify the amount of commissions on the website or in the support service of the payment system. Bookmakers themselves also have the right to charge fees for money transactions - but some platforms have abandoned this practice. Each payment method has minimum and maximum limits for deposits and withdrawals. To withdraw large winnings, cryptocurrencies are usually optimal - they either have no maximum limits at all, or they significantly exceed the limits of other payment systems.",

    "We have identified for you important criteria that you should definitely consider when choosing a virtual casino for playing for money. Taking into account these factors is your real protection against scammers in the gambling industry.",
  "rait_cas_li_2": "2. Casino license",
  "rait_cas_li_2_t":
    "No bonus programs and profitable promotions matter when a user comes to a casino that does not have a license. Only this document allows you to carry out gaming activities. Licensing is carried out by the gambling regulator or directly by the government of the country in whose jurisdiction the establishment is registered. Trusted world-famous operators undergo such a procedure in the Isle of Man, Curacao, Alderney and some others, they may have permission issued by regulators in Malta or in the UK. There is no need for a licensed establishment to hide licensing information. The document number and other data are usually indicated directly on the sites at the bottom of the page. To check the authenticity of the information, just go to the web resource of the licensing authority and check the validity of the license by number. For a player, having a license is a legal protection. If for some reason you have a conflict with the institution (you will be denied the payment of a large win, for example, without real reason), you can contact the authorities that oversee gambling activities. And your situation will be reviewed by independent arbitrators within 3 weeks. There is no license - there are no guarantees of fair payments, no protection. Your account can be unreasonably blocked, and the gaming story will end there, and the dishonest operator will simply appropriate the money. Unlicensed establishments often “sin” by using twisted non-certified slots, they can falsify the results of the tournament and not only. It is almost impossible to force him to pay the money fairly afterwards - there are no sufficient legal instruments for the successful conduct of the case. Availability Make sure the online casino accepts players from your country. The list of banned countries is usually present on the site. If the institution does not accept resident gamblers from your country, you may later have difficulties with verification and withdrawal of winnings.",

  "rait_cas_li_3_t":
    "For any average player, from time to time there is a need to communicate with representatives of the support service to solve a particular problem. Check in advance that your institution has no problems receiving feedback. Before registering, make sure that the site has an online chat in which the operators really answer in the language of your everyday communication. The ideal option is to have several options for contacts. Let it be not only a live chat, but also an email address, and a phone number or Skype chat. Check in advance whether technical support works around the clock or answers customers only during the daytime. In the latter case, if you play at night, not a single problem can be solved quickly.",
  "rait_cas_li_4": "4. Deposit and withdrawal options",
  "rait_cas_li_4_t":
    "The more the site provides opportunities for replenishment of the account, the better. After all, the financial part of the issue in gambling for money is of paramount importance. Make sure that the casino provides withdrawal methods that suit you: bank cards, electronic wallets, various payment systems. Specify in advance: how quickly the funds are credited to the account, and whether there is a commission for depositing money; whether the casino requires that you wager your own deposit at least once (adequate establishments do not impose such requirements on their customers); in what currency you can replenish your account and play; how quickly withdrawal requests are processed, whether there are additional restrictions on the payment of own funds to players who, for example, take part in the bonus program; are there any limits (maximum and minimum) for withdrawing funds per day, week, month, etc. You should be alerted by the fact of excessively long processing of applications declared by the administration. For example, if the rules state that funds are withdrawn within 5-7 days, this is a long time. If the institution reserves the right to pay out large winnings in parts, it is also not worth contacting it. If applications are processed within a day - everything is fine!",
  "rait_cas_li_5": "5. How does reputation affect the choice of an online casino?",
  "rait_cas_li_5_t":
    "In the modern world, where access to any information is as accessible as possible, reputation plays almost a paramount role. This is the factor that an unscrupulous gambling establishment cannot influence. You can lure new players with hundreds of bonus programs with unimaginable generosity, but if the brand is “crushed” online by hundreds of negative reviews and complaints, you won’t be able to fight it. Reputational score is much more important than advertising. Studying reviews and other ratings is the best way to find a responsible and reliable operator. Independent ratings do not take into account the data published by the gambling clubs themselves. Third party online reviews help shape public opinion. And it is definitely worth relying on for a gambler.",
  "rait_cas_li_6": "6. Is it possible to make money in an online casino?",
  "rait_cas_li_6_t":
    "You should not take the casino as a place of work. In the classical sense, it is impossible to earn money here: no one can guarantee that, by constantly playing, a person can count on a stable income. Of course, if you are not a professional poker player. The situation is different there: competent strategies allow experienced players to win with enviable constancy. The average person should realize that no tactics and strategies are a 100% guarantee of winning. True, there are several recommendations that, although they will not allow you to become dollar millionaires, will help you not to thoughtlessly place bets in the first slot that comes across: Look for only proven, honest gambling establishments with a good rating and a spotless reputation to play. Choose from the list of slots those where there is the possibility of obtaining more or less large winnings. Such information will certainly be found on the site in the table with payments. Don't stop at one casino. If you win too often, the support service will certainly pay attention to you. Nevertheless, gambling clubs do not work in order to “get rich” for you - they are interested in earning money themselves. Take advantage of bonus offers. But only those where adequate wagering conditions apply. The average wager should not be more than x30 - x35. If you lose, do not seek to return the lost immediately. You can not play on emotions - only with a cold head. Pay attention to popular slots. This category includes slot machines that have been played most often. The more the slot is charged with the money of other players, the higher the probability of returning a big win.",
  "rait_cas_li_7": "7. Is it possible to beat the casino and how to do it",
  "rait_cas_li_7_t":
    "One should understand the work of probability theory. Each slot has its own “return” indicator. For verified providers, this figure is about 93-97%. What does it mean? 93% of the money invested in the machine is returned to the players as winnings. The remaining amount is the net income of the gambling establishment. Remember a few criteria: If previous users have lost enough funds, the probability of winning is significantly increased. The more money you invest in the game, the higher the chance of winning. It is impossible to hit a big jackpot by playing at the minimum bet. It is better to play on proven slots with a high payout percentage. It makes no sense to sit down at the machine, in which this figure is 70-75%. New slots often provide an opportunity to win. This is how software providers attract the attention of visitors. If the new appeared on the site just the other day, it's definitely worth a try. It is important to understand that each game in the institution has its own settings and functions according to a certain scheme. It is the understanding of this scheme that allows competent clients to take big winnings. But, of course, you should change casinos from time to time so that you are not interested in the JV and do not cut down on betting opportunities.",

    "It is important that the bookmaker's support communicates in Russian or another language that you are fluent in. Most browsers today have built-in automatic translators - but they should not be trusted 100%, as they do not always cope with the specific betting terminology. Support should be available around the clock and through several channels: live chat, phone, email, instant messengers. An additional way to contact the BC is the official accounts of the project in social networks. The quality of the support service is an important indicator of the quality of the office as a whole. Experienced bettors, even before creating an account in a new bookmaker, ask questions to support staff in order to assess how quickly and competently they respond.",
  "sport_import_criteria_li_2": "2. Security of your account",
  "sport_import_criteria_li_2_t":
    "All noteworthy bookmakers offer two-factor authentication (2FA). This means that entering a username and password is not enough to enter your account. You will receive an additional code by e-mail or phone, which you will need to enter on the BC website. In recent years, bookmakers have appeared on the market, whose websites work on the blockchain. This reduces the likelihood of fraud to zero, since the system records information about all the actions taken: from accepting bets to announcing the results of the match, from accruing a bonus to completing an application for withdrawing funds. It is impossible to remove this information from the blockchain or quietly overwrite it.",
  "sport_import_criteria_li_3": "3. Payments: How to withdraw funds to your details?",
  "sport_import_criteria_li_3_t":
    "Withdrawal rules depend not only on the bookmaker, but also on the payment system. Almost all systems charge commissions for financial transactions, so you should clarify in advance what percentage you will be charged. It is more profitable to focus on such bookmakers that do not add additional commissions to these deductions on their part.",
  "sport_import_criteria_li_4": "4. License",
  "sport_import_criteria_li_4_t":
    "Having a license is a fundamental criterion when choosing a bookmaker. The fact that the bookmaker has this document is a guarantee that: Your personal information will be kept strictly confidential. No third parties will under any circumstances have access to them. Rewards will be paid promptly and fairly. The bookmaker will not cheat, change odds or apply hidden fees. The license number and the name of the organization that issued it are usually placed either in the footer on the main page or in the “About Us” section. If you do not see this information on the site, contact technical support. Then go to the website of the organization that issued the bookmaker a license and make sure that the office is really mentioned there.",
  "sport_import_criteria_li_5": "5. Bonuses",
  "sport_import_criteria_li_5_t":
    "It should also be noted here that when choosing a bookmaker, you should not focus on the number and variety of bonuses. The main thing in all incentive promotions is how appropriate they are. Calculate in advance whether the benefit received from the bonus will exceed the costs that will have to be incurred in order to receive it? Does the wager suit you? Will you meet the time allotted to use the bonus? The office will try to influence your emotions - but you must think pragmatically."
